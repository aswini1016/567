******ReactJs:-
-JavaScript having libraries and frameworks
libraries: it is a collection of codes.
-less set of rules
-reactjs, jquery etc..
frameworks: it is a collection of libraries
-more set of rules.
-angular, vuejs etc..

important features of ReactJs:-
1.ReactJs is JavaScript library to build rich reusable user interface.
2.ReactJs is faster because of "virtual DOM".
3.React follows component based architecture.
4.React follows unidirectional data flow..
5.React follows both client-side rendering and server-side rendering.
--React was introduced by facebook in 2011 developed by Jordan walke
--2013 react made as a open source.
--react is a free and platform independent.

to install react app:-
******
-install node js 
-node -v
-npm install create -react-app --globally
-npm init react-app myapp
-npx create-react-app myapp
-vite react


cd myapp
npm start
-React is mainly used to create single page applications.

what is virtual Dom?
-virtual dom is a virtual reprsenetation of a UI which is kept in a memory later synced with Real Dom with the help of a library called "ReactDom".

- The updation of real dom with virtal DOM
-the entire process of updating the realdom with the help of vdom os called "reconicaltion"

JSX:-
-jsx stands for javascript and XMl
-Jsx is a javascript extension used to create HTMl-like markup in the react.
-Actual way to create a elemnt in react is by using a method called as,
     -React.CreateElemnt("div)

     Rules of JSX:-
     **************
     1.every element irrespective of paired/unpaired  tag must be closed 
     ex:<h1></h1>

     rcc for class 
     rafc for function

Props:-
******
-props is nothing but a properties similar 

- React is mainly used to create single page applications.

what is virtual DOM ?
- Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory later 
    synced with Real DOM with the help of a library called "ReactDOM".

- The updation of real dom with virtual DOM.

- the entire process of updating the realDOM with the help of VDOM is called as "Reconcialtion".

JSX:-
*****
- JSX stands for Javascript and XML.
- JSX is a javascript syntax extension used to create HTML-like markup in the react.
- Actual way to create a element in react is by using a method called as,
        - React.createElement("tagname" , {property:"value"}/null , content/children)
         let ele  = React.createElement("div" , {className:"App"} , 
    React.createElement("h1" ,null, "Header")
  );

- JSX is not a part of react but it is recomended to use in react.

Rules of JSX:-
**************
1.every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed.
ex:-  <h1></h1> , <input/>
2.more than one jsx element is used then they must wrapped with one parent element.
ex:- <div>
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
        </div>

JSX expression:-
****************
- JSX expression is used to call the variable , mathematical expressio inside the element.
syntax :- <h1>{variable/expression}</h1>

components:-
************
- components are the files/modules which consist of js related logics which can be reuse.

components are divided into two types:-
1.class based components(CBC)
2.fucntional based components(FBC)


1.class based components(CBC):-
*******************************
- CBC is simlar to javscript es6 class.
- CBC are "statefull" component because of default  state object present inside the class.
syntax:-

 class Person{
    constructor(name , age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
 }

class Child extends Person{
    constructor(name , age , city){
        super(name , age);
        this.city=city;
    }
}

syntax :- 
class App extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;

2.functional based component:-
******************************
- FBC are similar to JS functions.
- FBC are "stateless" because there is no state object untill react v16.8.

syntax :-  function App(){
                return(

                )
            }
            export default App;

            OR
            const App=()=>{
                return(
                    //jsx
                )
            }
            export default App;

Notee :- while ctreating a react compoennt the names must be started with capital letters.
- extension of a component file must be .jsx/.js
- How to call a component.
    <App/> / <App></App>

component omposition:-
**********************
- component composition is used to combine multiple components into single application.


Props:-
*******
- props is nothing but a properties similar to html attributes.
- props is an object.
- props is an object used to exchange information/data from parent component to child component.


props.children:-
